#### Awesome Repositories

There are several implementations of classical deep learning methods that I highly recommend:

- [Deep Learning Paper Implementations](https://github.com/labmlai/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations)

- [Papers-in-100-Lines-of-Code](https://github.com/MaximeVandegar/Papers-in-100-Lines-of-Code)
